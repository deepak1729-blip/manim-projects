# manim-projects
A collection of mathematical animations created with Manim.

Mathematical Animations & Visual IntuitionThis repository serves as a portfolio of my work in mathematical animation, specifically utilizing Manim to translate abstract concepts into grounded, visual narratives.

My goal is to create animations that:
Prioritize Intuition: Moving beyond symbols to show the "geometry of the change."
Maintain Deliberate Pacing: Using my experience as a dubbing artist for 3Blue1Brown to ensure visuals are perfectly synced with the narrative flow.
Bridge the Gap: Showing the relationship between algebraic rigor and visual "Aha!" moments.

Featured Project: The Clock Hand ProblemA 3-minute exploration of a classic related rates problem: How fast is the distance between the tips of a clock's hands changing at 1:00?
Algebraic Method: A derivation using the Law of Cosines.
Graphical Method: A vector-based approach visualizing the relative velocities of the hand tips.

Tooling: Built entirely in Manim.
